# Introduction
This is an program to display discord overlays (voice chat/messages/server status) in any fullscreen application under macOS.  
Since discord does not officially support overlays so I made this program for me when playing the rhythm game "osu!".  

The program is made with discord streamkit so keep in mind that some features are not supported due to limitations.

Features      | Work
------------- | -------------
Show users when someone joining the vc | :white_check_mark:
Green border around the avatar when someone speaks | :white_check_mark:
Show the mute/deafen status | :x:
Show an eye when someone is watching your stream | :x:
Show the stream icon when someone is streaming | :x:

## Installation
Download the .dmg from [release page](https://github.com/Naozumi520/discordOverlayMac/releases/edit/untagged-1f72c3ba8b82418ca30a), open the .dmg file and drag the `discordOverlay.app` to the Applications folder.

## How to use
In the menu Click either button (won't affect anything) to enter the overlay setup.  
Adjust as you want then press `control^ + enter` key to start the overlay.  
To stop the overlay you can just click the blue "x" button and for the whole program just close the program directly.

Other modes like server status/channel messages work fine as well!
