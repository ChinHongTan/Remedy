# Introduction
Remedy is a application for displaying an overlay of discord voice channels even in fullscreen application under macOS.  

# Motivation
I made this app because the discord overlay is currently only available for Windows. This annoys me a bit because I use the feature a lot. (Who doesn't want to some little games and chat even on the mac?)

# About the application
Remedy comes in two editions, Standard and Pro. This app was made using the Discord streaming kit which had limited function, so in order to perform like the official Discord client (see the table below), some tricks have to be used. But it uses some selfbot-related tricks which against the Discord TOS. If you're not happy with that, you can just use the standard version, but it's convenient.

Trigg shows us the possibility of getting mute/deafen status on the discord streamkit.  
His project has inspired me a lot.
